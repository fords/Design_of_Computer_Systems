Implementation of 12-bit Pipelined RISC Processor
Project descriptionUsing Verilog in Altera Quartus environment and Mentor Graphics ModelSim simulation, 12-bit RISC processor with control unit was developed. The assembler for the CPU was implemented in Python programming language. Starting with the design of Asynchronous State Machine (ASM), the control unit was created. The CPU was designed and verified with SIMD instruction sets on simulation and hardware DE0-Nano board. The matrix operation test was executed on Altera Cyclone 4 FPGA DE0-Nano board.
